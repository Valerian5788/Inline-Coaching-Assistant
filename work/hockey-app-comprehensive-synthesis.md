### Store Architecture

#### App Store (`src/stores/appStore.ts:1-48`)
- Selected team persistence
- Current/active season management
- Cross-session state persistence

#### Game Store (`src/stores/gameStore.ts:1-341`)
- Live game state management
- Timer control and game time tracking
- Shot and goal recording
- Event logging
- Game lifecycle management

### Routing Structure
```
/ - Home dashboard
/teams - Team and player management
/seasons - Season management  
/games - Game creation and management
/live - Live tracking dashboard
  /live/tracking - Full-screen shot tracking
  /live/draw - Tactical drawing (placeholder)
  /live/stats - Live statistics (placeholder)
/analysis - Post-game data analysis
```

## 3. Known Issues & Incomplete Parts

### Timer System Issues
- Timer persists across browser sessions but may desync
- No automatic period end handling when time reaches zero
- Manual time adjustments don't validate against period limits

### Data Consistency
- No data validation on shot coordinates (could be outside valid range)
- Jersey number uniqueness not enforced per team
- Game deletion cascades but no confirmation warnings for data loss

### UI/UX Limitations
- No undo functionality for shots or events
- Limited shot editing capabilities once recorded
- No bulk operations for games or players

### Missing Core Features
- Player substitution tracking during games
- Penalty tracking and power play analytics
- Faceoff win/loss tracking
- Advanced shot types (wrist shot, slap shot, etc.)
- Player-specific shot attribution

### Performance Considerations  
- Large datasets not optimized (no pagination)
- All shots loaded simultaneously for analysis
- No data archiving or cleanup utilities

## 5. Next Steps & Priorities

### 🔴 High Priority Fixes

1. **Timer System Refinement**
   - Add automatic period end detection
   - Implement time validation for manual adjustments
   - Add timer state recovery after browser refresh

2. **Data Validation**
   - Enforce jersey number uniqueness per team
   - Validate shot coordinates are within rink bounds
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

3. **Core Feature Completion**
   - Implement meaningful home dashboard with recent games/stats
   - Add player assignment to shots during tracking
   - Create shot editing/deletion capabilities

### 🟡 Medium Priority Enhancements

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Player-specific shot attribution and statistics
   - Heat map generation for shot locations
   - Comparative analysis between games/seasons

5. **Live Tracking Improvements**
   - Penalty tracking system
   - Faceoff win/loss recording
   - Player substitution logging

6. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for shot tracking
   - Implement undo/redo functionality
   - Create bulk operations for data management

### 🟢 Low Priority Features

7. **Advanced Features**
   - Export data to CSV/JSON formats
   - Import game data from external sources
   - Multi-language support
   - Offline PWA capabilities

8. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement data pagination for large datasets
   - Add database indexing for better query performance
   - Create data archiving system for old seasons

### 🎯 Immediate Development Focus

**Most Critical Path**: Complete the timer system and add player shot attribution, as these are core to the app's primary use case of live game tracking. The shot tracking interface is already excellent - it just needs to connect shots to specific players to provide meaningful analytics.

**Technical Debt**: The database schema and stores are well-designed and can handle the additional complexity. The main challenge will be UX design for quickly selecting players during fast-paced live tracking.

## Summary

This is a well-architected hockey coaching application with a solid foundation. The core live tracking and analytics features are implemented and functional. The main gaps are in data completeness (player attribution) and some edge case handling. The technical implementation is clean, using modern React patterns with comprehensive TypeScript coverage and a robust local database solution.
