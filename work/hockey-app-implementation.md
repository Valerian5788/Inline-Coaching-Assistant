- **GoalAgainst**: id, gameId, period, timestamp, x, y, reason

### Database Layer
- Complete Dexie.js setup with IndexedDB
- Helper functions for all CRUD operations
- Offline-first data storage
- Relationship management between entities

## Pages Implemented

### 1. Home Page ✅

- ✅ **Team management** - Full CRUD for teams and players
- ✅ **Navigation** - Mobile-friendly with icon navigation

### Technical Features
- ✅ **PWA support** - Installable web app
- ✅ **TypeScript throughout** - Type safety
- ✅ **Error handling** - Proper error boundaries
- ✅ **Build optimization** - Production-ready builds

## Bugs Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Tailwind CSS PostCSS Plugin Issue
**Problem**: Build failed with error about PostCSS plugin configuration
```
It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin
```

**Solution**: 
- Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of `tailwindcss`

### 2. TypeScript Import Errors
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript errors about type imports
```
'Table' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import when 'verbatimModuleSyntax' is enabled
```

**Solution**:
- Changed all type imports to use `import type { ... }` syntax
- Updated imports in: `db/index.ts`, `stores/*.ts`, `pages/Teams.tsx`

### 3. Dexie OrderBy Method Issues
**Problem**: TypeScript errors on `.orderBy()` method calls
```
Property 'orderBy' does not exist on type 'Collection<Game, any, Game>'
```

**Solution**:
- Simplified database queries by removing `.orderBy()` calls
- Implemented sorting in application layer instead of database layer

### 4. NPX Command Issues with PNPM
**Problem**: `npx tailwindcss init -p` failed with pnpm
```
No binaries found in tailwindcss
```

**Solution**:
- Manually created `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
- Used proper configuration for Tailwind CSS v4

### 5. React Import Not Needed
**Problem**: TypeScript warning about unused React import
```
'React' is declared but its value is never read
```

**Solution**:
- Removed unnecessary `import React from 'react'` from App.tsx
- Modern React with JSX transform doesn't require explicit React import

## Build Process

### Development
```bash
cd hockey-coaching-app
pnpm install
pnpm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Production
```bash
pnpm run build  # Creates optimized build with PWA
pnpm run preview  # Preview production build
```

### Key Commands Used
- `pnpm add` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm add -D` - Install dev dependencies  
- `pnpm run dev` - Development server
- `pnpm run build` - Production build

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### High Priority
1. **Seasons Management** - CRUD operations for seasons
2. **Games Management** - Game creation, scheduling, status tracking
3. **Live Tracking Interface** - Real-time shot tracking with rink visualization
4. **Basic Analytics** - Shot charts and basic statistics

### Medium Priority
5. **Data Visualization** - Heat maps using Recharts
6. **Advanced Analytics** - Performance metrics and trends
7. **Export Functionality** - Data export to various formats
8. **Enhanced UI Components** - shadcn/ui component library

### Low Priority
9. **Draw Play Feature** - Tactical board implementation
10. **Advanced PWA Features** - Push notifications, background sync
11. **Multi-team Support** - Manage multiple teams
12. **Data Import/Export** - Backup and restore functionality

## Lessons Learned

1. **Package Manager Consistency**: Stick with one package manager (pnpm) throughout the project
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Modern TS configs require explicit type imports
3. **Tailwind v4 Changes**: New PostCSS plugin structure requires different setup
4. **Database Queries**: Keep database layer simple, handle complex operations in application layer
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, add advanced features incrementally

## Final Status

The hockey coaching app MVP is **fully functional** with:
- ✅ Complete development environment setup
- ✅ Working team and player management
- ✅ Offline-first data storage
- ✅ Production-ready build process
- ✅ PWA configuration
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI

The foundation is solid and ready for expanding into a full-featured coaching application.
